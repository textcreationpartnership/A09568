            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I thought it therefore my bounden dutye, to gratifie your Lordſhip at this preſent, and alſo (as proceding from your honour) the reſidue of my countrey men, with this my ſimple labour. Whiche though many might haue done it better, yet I haue done my good wyll: being not only incited and encouraged therevnto, by the vulgare report of your clementie and gratefull accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of diuers other mens labours in ſuch lyke enterpriſes: but alſo by the worthines of the worke and ſplendent fame of the authour, whoſe worthy Chronicle as touching the eſtate of religion and the weale publike vnder the Emperour Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les the fifte, for as muche as the cuſtodie thereof in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhe tongue was exhibited vnto your honour, I thought I could not choſe a more fitter Patron for this litle booke, then him who had alreadie (by thankfull accepting of the foreſaide Chronicle) declared his good will to the Authour. To make diſcourſe vnto your Lordſhip concerning the goodnes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentnes thereof, and the benefite that may therefrom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounde vnto all ſuch as are ſtudious. I thynke I ſhuld (as the prouerbe is) but powre water into the ſea, for as much as the ſame is farre better deſcribed in the authours own preface, as alſo the cauſes that moued him to take in hand the ſame, then I ſhould haue bene able to haue penned it. Not withſtanding this much I may well ſay with Thucidides, that amonges all other writtyngs hiſtories is a treaſure, which neuer ought to
<pb facs="tcp:15027:3"/>be out of our hands, to the end that being ayded thereby, we might the better handle ſuch lyke buſyneſſes and chaunces in the common weales: for albeit that the perſons are chaunged and haue geuen place to nature, yet the ſame or the lyke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and chaunces happen dayly. Yea I maye boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that it much auayleth them that be in authoritie, to marke diligently in the reading of hiſtories, the actes of all ages, to the end that they hauing examples layed before their eyes both of good and euyll regiment, and of the bleſſing of God vpon good gouernours, and of the iuſte wrathe of God diuerſly powred vppon the contrary ſort, may learne to folow the good and eſchewe the euyll. Nowe briefely to finiſhe, my humble requeſt is, firſt that it wold pleaſe you to accept in no worſe part this my ſimple and ſmale offer, then as the preſent of one that earneſtly wiſheth you all felicitie, who woulde haue geuen better, yf his abilitie had to his good wyll bene correſpondant: and conſequently to pardon my boldnes, and to beare with the rudeneſſe of my ſtyle. And in ſo doing I ſhal thynke my ſelfe not onely much bound vnto your honour, but alſo be earneſtly moued to praye vnto God to maintaine you in your eſtate, to proſper and further all your good purpoſes, to encreaſe you in vertue, and keepe you in good health and proſperitie.</p>

After the Bible it conſequently behoueth to know all that which is writen of other nations.<note place="margin">Nothinge comineth to paſſe, whiche is not found prefigured in the hiſtories,</note> For nothing almoſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to paſſe but thereof is, &amp; a great while agone hath bene, ſet out ſome reſemblaunce. Wherin the gouernours of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales haue great ayde and ſuccour, prouided that they be not careles in this kind of inſtruction. Now the way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole courſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is deuided into foure Empires, is moſt to the purpoſe. As for the firſt Empyre, we are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of neceſſarie bookes, and ſauing the holy Scriptures we haue almoſt nothing worthy to be credited, or wherevpon we may grounde our ſelues. That age no doubt was altogether heroicall, and moſt notable in excellent things and worthy of Memorie: but how much thereof is come to our knowledge? Semiramis is greatly renoumed, and Babilon, and Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus: and what? That is almoſt all. But who is he that maketh mention of that horrible ſpectacle, and ſo terrible and monſterous as euer happened vnto man, which Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſor (according as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Daniel) reciteth of himſelf?<note place="margin">Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſor a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpectacle,</note> To witte that ſo mightye a kinge &amp; Monarche became madde was caſt out of his kyngdome, banniſhed the throne of hys
<pb facs="tcp:15027:8"/>anceſters, driuen from and excluded the companye of men, and ſo to alter nature that he fedde wyth wylde beaſtes, and was tranfourmed into their lykenes? The things are there but ſimplie mentioned: but how greatly thinke we were they aſtoniſhed, that dyd ſée thys ſo pitifull an example of the maieſtie and wrathe of God? The Empyre therefore of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, or of Babilon, is briefely diſcribed, becauſe it is requiſed to kéepe wythin the bandes of the holy ſcriptures. The thrée o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers folowing, chiefly that of Grecia and of Rome, are great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly illuminated by the writtinges of Herodotus,<note place="margin">Greke hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers.</note> Thucidides, Xenophon, and Polibius. For Pherecides, Hellanicus, Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilas, Philliſtus, Agathocles, Theopompus, Ephorus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes, Timeus, Clitarchus, Silenus, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cicero ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention are periſhed. The Latins alſo that did wrytte the ancient Romain Hiſtorie, &amp; who are named by Cicero, are not to be found: as are the <hi>Annales Pontificum,</hi> Fabius Pictor, M. Portius Cato,<note place="margin">Latin Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers.</note> Lucius Piſo, Celius Antipater, Caius Fannius, Vennonius, Clodius, Aſilo, Accius, Lucius Siſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na. Theſe are they out of whom T. Liuius, for the moſt part mutilate, and Saluſtius more ancient, alſo vnperfecte, haue collected their Hiſtorye. Cicero truly did neuer write Hiſtorie, albeit that he diligently laboured therein, accordinge as hys bookes doe teſtifie, out of the which we maye aptely gather all that hath bene aunciently done: yea, he hath bene meruelous curious to obſerue the time, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may orderly gather out of him, both the time of things &amp; perſons, without the which all that is writen is obſcure. And for becauſe that the ſaid Cicero was wont to ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſpecially appertained to an Oratour to write an Hiſtory, chiefly according to the maner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grekes, Pomponius Atticus exhorted him thervnto,<note place="margin">Cicero ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to wrytte Hiſtories.</note> ſaying in maner of a complainte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was yet wanting vnto the Latins, &amp; that it lay in Cicero to bring to paſſe that in ſuch ſtile Rome ſhould not be inferiour vnto Grecia. It is certaine that he compoſed in Gréeke the Hiſtorie abridged of his conſulſhyp, &amp; beganne it in Latin, as he ſaieth. For he greatlye deſired that that hys
<pb facs="tcp:15027:8"/>yeare ſhould be renoumed by the writings of others: in ſuche ſort that he ſaid that if others wold not put to their handes, he wold not faile, &amp; wold write of himſelf. C. Ceſar treateth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his owne actes,<note place="margin">

Curſius: but amongeſt them ſome are vtterly loſte, other ſome are for the moſt part. Since theſe, diuers others haue written the Hiſtorie of their time, or of their nation, and reach euen vnto this our age.<note place="margin">The vtilius of Hiſtories</note> Theſe truly ought to be redde, or at the leaſt the moſt parte of them, to get by them the knowledge which is requiſed and neceſſarye. It behoueth to know ſome for the thing it ſelf, other ſome for the thing &amp; for the ſtyle: amongeſt whom C.<note place="margin">Iulius Caeſar.</note> Ceſar maye almoſt onely haue to himſelf the firſt place of the latins, yea and that rightlye. For there is nothinge more pure nor more eloquent then he: ſo that not onely he hath ſurmounted them who ſhort<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly after folowed him, in pleaſantnes of ſpeach, but alſo all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his time.

But ſeing that this kinde of ſtudye doth properly appertaine (as it hath bene ſaid in the beginning) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them who ought to haue the gouernement of the people, I thought I ſhould doe according to your age and eſtate, Duke Eberard, if I did make you partaker of this my litle labour: to the end that (yf it be poſſible) other yonge men mighte take ſome profite by your meanes, &amp; as it were by your hands. For albeit that Iohn Sigiſmond, &amp; Sebaſtian Coccius, your moſt honozable maiſters, doe with all diligence employe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to inſtructe &amp; teach you. Yet notwithſtanding, as our accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med maner is, whan a garden is to be dreſſed, which we deſire to be exquiſite and decked with ſondry flowers, not to deſpyſe the litles plantes &amp; herbes brought vnto vs from other places: ſo likwiſe I hope that the litle preſent which I offer vnto you to garniſhe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground of your wytte, ſhalbe very acceptable vn to you. And truely I preſent it onely vntil ſuch time as hauing gotten more ſtrength (as it hath bene ſaid) you might rightlye walke through the wide fieldes &amp; grene places. Which to doe you haue an example of your owne kinred, to witte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue of your father, a prince of moſt worthy praiſe, who hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augmented and decked the noblenes of his race by an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent doctrine: and which is the chiefeſt he hath brought thys knowledge to her right ende:<note place="margin">The trewe ſcope of all ſciences.</note> that is to ſaye, that the name of of god might be ſainctified: that the Churches &amp; ſcholes might be well ordered: that good teachers &amp; ſcholers might be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and interteined. This is the duetie that god requireth
<pb facs="tcp:15027:9"/>chiefly of them of your eſtate: and as he auengeth the neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof with great plagues, ſo likewiſe he doth rewarde them with great giftes, that behaue themſelues therein as faithfull ſtuardes. Diuers leſſons might be recited of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, conſtancie, &amp; valiantnes, of your moſt noble father: but you ſhall hereafter read them handled more at large, and ſhall know the ornamentes of your noblenes. For how can it be, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he who ſo much fauoureth good wittes, ſhould not finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of them ſuch fruite of their thankfulnes, as he deſerueth and ſhould not be renoumed in the time to come?

            <p>The vniuerſall flood is referred to the .M. CCCCCC. LU I. yere after the creation of the worlde.<note place="margin">The yere the flood</note> Methuſalah the ſeuenth from Adam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that tyme, at the age of nyne hundred &amp; ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nyne yeres. Noah the nephew of Methuſalah
<pb facs="tcp:15027:10"/>by Lameth his ſonne, liued then beyng ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yere olde, he with his familie was preſerued by the ſingular grace of God. And after that the number of men beganne by lytle and lytle to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, he perſwaded his chyldren &amp; others of his poſteritie to ſcatter them ſelues in diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys to fyll the earth, &amp; to buyld cities &amp; townes: and to that ende, he appoynted vnto euery one by lot hys Prouince, aboute an hundreth yeares after the flood.</p>
            <p>At that time Nimrod ſonne to Noahs nephew abode with his people in the land of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chaldees.

The towne tooke her name of this confuſion of
<pb facs="tcp:15027:11"/>tongues, for it was called Babell. And from that tyme (to witte, an hundreth and one and thyrtye yeres after the flood) is gathered the begynnyng of the raygne of Chaldea and of Babilon. Nowe the firſt kyng was the aforeſayde Nimrod,<note place="margin">Nimrod the firſt kinge of Chaldea.</note> who (as it is ſayde) raygned ſixe and fiftie yeares. The holy ſcripture calleth hym a mighty hunter, and doeth attribute vnto hym power and violence: others call hym Saturne, &amp; they ſay that in the fyue and fourtye yere of hys Empyre he ſent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur, Mede, Magog, and Moſcus, for to guyde the bandes of men whiche he ſent to inhabite here and there, and for to grounde and eſtabliſh king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of theyr names, to witte, of Aſſiria, of Mede, of Magog, and of Moſcus: whereof the two fyrſt apperteyne vnto Aſia: the other two laſt appertayne vnto Affrica, and vnto Europa.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:15027:13"/>
            <p>Theſe two Lieutenantes did afterwards diuide the Monarchie betwene them. Belochus was kyng of Babilon, and Arbaces of the Medes and Perſians. Sardanapalus then was the laſte kynge of the Aſſirians accordynge to the order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mencioned, after that this Monarchie had continued M.CCC. yeres: for the moſte parte of the kynges dyd lyue a very long tyme. Belochus, the .xxxix. or elles if it ſeeme better the firſt kynge of Aſſiria in the newe Monarchie,<note place="margin">Belochus the firſt king of Aſſiria in the newe Monarche.</note> made Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem kyng of Iſraell become tributarie vnto hym. The holy ſcriptures doth not call him Belochus, but Phul. Hys ſucceſſour was Phull Aſſur, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Tiglath Pilleſſer: who wanne certayue townes of Iudea and led the people captiue into Aſſiria. It is that Tiglath, whome Achas kyng of Iudea (vnder whome Eſay lyued) prayed to ſuccour hym againſt the kyng of Siria, and vnto whome he ſent preſentes.</p>
            <p>Salmanaſar ſucceded hym,<note place="margin">Salmana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</note> who wanne the towne of Samaria, after he had beſeged it three yeres, and led Hoſea kyng of Iſraell, wyth the people, captiue, &amp; gaue them a dwellynge place in hys countrey, euen in Medea, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture ſaith: wherof ſome haue opinion that he raigned alſo ouer the Medes. Sennacherib folowed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him,<note place="margin">Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therib.</note> who kept hys dwellyng in Nineue. He condemned kyng Ezechias in a great ſumme of money: afterwards he came and befeged Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with a mighty army, and by the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours that he dyd ſende, he exhorted the people
<pb facs="tcp:15027:13"/>to yelde and guye ouer, and rayled on the kung, who hoped for ſuccour at the hand of God. But he remayned not vnpuniſhed: for euen in one night he loſte an hundred foure ſcoure and fyne thouſande men, that were kylled by the Angell: the whiche God euen a lytle before had fyrmely promiſed by Eſay, vnto Ezechias the kyng. And beyng retourned home from thence, he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered euen of his owne children,</p>
            <p>Hitherto the Babilonians were ſubiect to the Aſſirians, after the ouerthrowe of Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus: but after that Sennacherib (as it is ſayde) was ſo euyll handled nere vnto Ieruſalem, and ſhortly ſlayne of hys chyldren, thynges were greatly chaunged, and the kyngdome was diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

            <p>After him certain authours do place Benmero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach &amp; Nabuchodonozor the firſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name:<note place="margin">Benmero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach.

He then ſhortly after the beginning of his raigne, made war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Egiptians, &amp; toke from them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey which is from Euphrates vnto Pelluſiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He layed tribute vpon Ioachim king of Iudea: &amp; the .viii. yere of his raigne he brought his ſonne king Ieconias captiue into Babilon, with the chief lords &amp; artificers not onely of the citie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, but alſo of the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey.

Ieremy did foreſhew this miſerie, in the firſt yere of the raign of Nabuchodonozor, &amp; from that time, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the .lxx. yeres of the captiuitie in Babilon.</p>
            <p>About the .xxiiii. yere of hys Empyre, after that Nabuchodonozor had vanquiſhed the kyngs of the Amonites &amp; Moabites, he led his army into Egipt: &amp; hauyng gotten the whole countrey, he afterwards began his Monarche. The ſecond yere of his ſayd Monarche, as the learned men of our tyme do recken, he ſaw in hys dreame a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous

Vho after he was awaked, becauſe he had forgotten his drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and yet not withſtandyng was greatly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed therwith, he called together all the ſoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, and charmers, whome he commaunded to declare vnto him what his dreame was: the which yf they dyd not, he threatened to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death.<note place="margin">Daniel.</note> yong Daniel (who was thither led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue with the reſidue from Ieruſalem) knowyng thys, he gaue to vnderſtand that he could ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the kyngs deſyre: who beyng preſented, he firſt of all ſhewed what the kyng had dreamed: then afterwards he declared what the dreame dyd ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie, ſaying that the ymage did ſignifie the foure principall Empyres of the world, which ſhould orderly follow one after another. Herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he ſpake on this maner vnto the kyng, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thou truly art y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> head of gold: thou (I ſay) whome God hath endued with power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, vnto whome he hath geuen domination ouer all men, ouer all beaſtes of the fielde, and ouer the foules of the ayre. After thee ſhall aryſe another kyngdome of ſyluer: that is to ſaye, worſe than thys of thyne. The thyrde ſhall be of Braſſe, whyche ſhall haue domination farre abroade.

<pb facs="tcp:15027:15"/>ſo ſhall that fourth and laſte kyngdome, beate downe all the others, and ſhall make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it.

            <p>This fell in the yeare of the foundation of Rome. CCLXVI. Herodotus which was before Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides dyd diſcribe thys warre of the Perſyans.

Darius the Baſtarde reigned after longhand, whoſe ſiſter he had in mariage. The a boue ſaid warre of the Peloponeſians fell duryng his raygne, and albeit that the Athenians had alreadye ynough to doe: yet neuertheles the fourth yeare of thys warre they ſente an armie by Sea vnto Sycilia, faynynge to helpe the Leontins agaynſt the Saragoſſens: but of trewth, it was for nothing els then to aſſubiecte that Ile vnder them: the whych yf they dyd, they might the better vainquiſhe all Grecia.</p>

For becauſe that their Kyng Ptolemeus Epiphanes, being then but of fewe yeares, was not apt to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the publyke weale, and for that they ſtood in great feare of Antiochus: they ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to Rome, by whome they did deſyer the Senate to take the lytle king into their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.

            <p>After hys ouerthrowe he was wont to ſaye (as Cicero reciteth) that the Romaine people had done hym a great pleaſure, in eaſynge hym from ouer great charge, and in leauing him ſo ſtraight limittes of hys countrey.

Euery one doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ceſar was very clement &amp; mercifull.

Now in al theſe doinges Cicero was greatly variable &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war he ioyned himſelfe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campe of Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peius &amp; toke his part albeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did reprehend his faint hart &amp; his negligence.

But after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peius was diſpatched, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ceſar pardoned diuers, he changed his time &amp; note: and in three orations whiche he made, he exalted him euen to the verye heauen, ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye dyd he prayſe and magynifye hym.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:15027:42"/>
            <p>And ſence that Ceſer had bene aduertiſed that he was conſpired againſt, and that oftentimes he braſt forth in theſe words, that he had lyued long ynough: Cicero prayed and beſoughte hym to put away y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fantaſye. For althoughe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had gotten as much glory as was poſſible, &amp; that in reſpecte hereof he had lyued long ynough for himſelf: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had liued to lytle a whyle for the publike weale, the which could not well want or be deſtitute of his ſuccour and defence.

For becauſe that after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Ceſar, Antonius did trouble the publike weale he commaunded vnto the Senate C.

            <p>About the tyme of theſe tumults and troubles of Conſtantinople, the fame of Charles kyng of
<pb facs="tcp:15027:75"/>Fraunce was very great. For he hauing put ende to the warre of Spayne, came into Italy wyth his armie at the requeſt of Adrianus Byſhoppe of Rome. And euen as Pipine hys father had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Aiſtulphus king of the Lombards, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe he after long ſeyge toke Deſiderius the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of Aiſtulphus,<note place="margin">The kyng of the Lom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bards take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne.</note> who greatly moleſted Italy and Adrianus the fyrſt of that name.

For ſince Conſtantinus the great y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romain Emperours were placed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre of, to witte, in Conſtantinople: and were not only encumbred with forren warres, but alſo with ciuill and domeſticall diſſentions tumultes and debats.

Moreouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part of them were at great ſtrife wyth the Byſhoppes of Rome, and for ſpyte they bare them, they did not greatly withſtand the aduancement of the Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards.

So therfore the Weaſt Empyre fell into the Germayns hands: for it is not to be doubted, whether Pipyne and Charles weare Germayns.

As touching the Eaſt Emperours it is certayn that ſynce Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus they haue bene alwaies tormented and troubled wyth warres.

            <p>Hetherto I hauing made as it were a preface of Charlemaine and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Almains, from henceforth I wil briefly rounne ouer and declare how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> part of the Romayn Empyre whych is towards the Weſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was recollected and reeſtablyſhed by Charlemaine, is agayn fallen into decaye: and beyng deuided into diuers Prouinces, hath bene vnto diuers who poſſeſſe thoſe countryes neither more nor leſſe then their owne proper Heritage, without conſidering their ofſpring: in ſuch ſort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this venerable and ſo renoumed hyghnes of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn Empyre is at this day no other thing then a lytle ſhadow of a great body, ſynce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of ſo great a large compaſſe it hath bene encloſed in a ſmall part of Europa, to wytte in Germanie. Laſt of all I will in few words declare how Daniell hath for ſhewed theſe mutations of Empires, and the fall of the Romain monarchie. Ludouicus then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of Charlemaine, the ſecond Germayn Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, renued the amitie wyth Leo of Armenia Emperour of Grecia.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15027:82"/>and diligently that fact, declaryng that he againſt his will was there placed. The bookes of the Popes containe that the Emperour Ludoui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ratifyed vnto Paſchal and to hys ſucceſſours the poſſeſſion of goods, &amp; that he permitted the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection frely vnto them: ſo that he ſhould be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and holden for Pope, whom all the Romains ſhould haue Iudged worthy of that eſtate. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what credite a man ſhould giue vnto ſuch writtings: for they agree ſo yll, &amp; are placed in ſo yll order, that none can vnderſtand that whych ought to folow.

But he obtayned nothyng, albeit that certayn dyd obey therevnto. The Byſhop of Halberſtat,

            <p>The Emperour had broken his army, and ſent backe the Princes that were come to his ſuccour, after the diſcomfitour of the Saxons: but vnder condition that they ſhould ariue towards him all in armes the .xxiiii. of October.

In his abſence he gaue the whole adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Otho of Bauieres, who was iſſued out of Saxony. Furthermore he ordayned a Byſhop vnto them of Bamberg &amp; of Coloigne and an abbot vnto them of Fulden.

The Emperour accepted theſe conditions: and as he was at Spire, it came in his brayne to goe into Italy, for to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Pope in Good tyme. He put hymſelfe then in Iourny wyth hys wyfe and hys lyttle ſonne, in the ſharppeſt of the wynter:<note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vſage of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through Bourgony and Sauoy wyth great dyfficulty and daunger of hys lyfe, at length he came into Italy, where the Prynees and Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of the Country louyngly accepted hym, ſuppoſyng that he was thether comme in dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure agaynſt the Pope.

            <p>Therfore he ſtayed to know the cauſe.

The fourth day finally he was admitted, &amp; then the Pope propounded vnto him theſe lawes: he ſhould repreſent himſelf to be examined, he ſhould aunſwere vnto the accuſations of the Princes. If he were conuicted he ſhould for goe the Empyre &amp; ſhould not conſpire any vengaunce.

After thys victorie, Albertus minding to aſſure himſelf, and fearing leaſt any ſhould ſay that the fyrſt election was not rightly conſtituted, required again to be ſolemnly elected: the which was done, albeit that Pope Bonifacius the eight did ſay there againſt, and did not approue that which had bene done of other princes. Shortly after as a great quarell was moued betwene him &amp; Philip the faire king of Fraunce, he confyrmed him Emperour: &amp; ſpake meruelous things in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laud &amp; praiſe of his houſe.

Furder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, thys litle horne maketh battell againſt the ſaincts, &amp; doth vehemently afflict them (as he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) vntil that the auncient, who hath neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning nor ending, ſhal come to make his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereof it plainly appeareth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe
<pb facs="tcp:15027:113"/>of this world ſhal take end in this empyre, &amp; none other ſhall folow: but that all principalties of the world being aboliſhed, that perpetuall kingdome ſhall come, whereof Chriſt ſhalbe the head &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor. In the .viii. Chap. Daniel diſcribeth the Ramme &amp; Goate.<note place="margin">The Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me &amp; the goate</note> Which afterwards thangel interpreteth euidently, &amp; ſayeth that the Ramme with two hornes ſignifieth the kings of the Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des &amp; Perſes, but the Goate the Greke empyre, &amp; that great horne in his forhead ſignifieth the firſt king of this Empyre: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this horne being bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken foure other ſucceded it, he ſayeth that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied foure kingdoms that ſhould ariſe and ſpring out of this Empyre, but that they ſhoulde not be able to compare neyther in ſtrength nor power with the aboueſaid firſt king. Let vs then ſe how properly Daniel hath paynted forth Alexander the great, CC. yeres and more before that he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned: for he ſayth that the Goate ſhuld not touch the ground,<note place="margin">Victories of Alexander.</note> that is to ſay, he ſhould diſpatch his warres with great ſpeede, and that none coulde ſaue the Ramme from his hands. For Alexander raigned but .xii. yeres: and in ſo litle a tyme he ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dued almoſt al Aſia, as we haue here aboueſayde. And albeit that the power of the Perſians &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des was vncredible, not withſtanding Darius was vanquiſhed of him in thre battells one after another, &amp; loſt his life &amp; Empyre. Certain ſay that when Alexander came into Ieruſalem, the chiefe prieſt recited vnto him this place of Daniel, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with he greatly reioyſed. As touching that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15027:113"/>horne ſhuld come out of theſe foure, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which at the firſt was very litle, but afterwards became merueylous great, &amp; which ſhuld greuouſly afflict the moſt holy places: he ſayeth that hereby is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ied the horrible perſecutions that the Iewes ſhuld ſuffer of the poſteritie of Alexander y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great, to wit, of the kings of Egipt &amp; Syria, betwene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which countreys Iudea is ſituated. Truely the Iewes haue experimented this horne ſprong out of the foure, to wit, Antiochus the noble, king of Syria, &amp; moſt cruel deſtroyer. Here is alſo to be ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plied the .xi. chapter where he ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aketh againe of Alexander and of his ſucceſſours ſo effectualy, that it ſeemeth no prophecie, but ſome hiſtorie. Finally let vs come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,<note place="margin">The image of Nebucho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>donozor.</note> wherof we haue ſpoken in the firſt booke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that occaſion was offered. I wil not repete thinterpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thre firſt empyres: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is altogether manifeſt, &amp; approued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe of times. I wil ſpeake only ſomwhat of the fourth, becauſe it toucheth vs who liue therin: &amp; is more ſeriouſly diſcribed by Daniel. He ſayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhuld be of iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhuld beat down &amp; ſubdue al other Empyres. It nedeth not many words to ſhew this: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing it ſelf maketh the profe by the hiſtories y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue recited. The fete &amp; the toes are partly of iron, &amp; partly of clay. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the fote of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body is clouen into toes, ſo after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the romain empire ſhalbe ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his leggs of iron &amp; haue had his dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole earth, he ſhal end in toes, &amp; this huge body ſhalbe diſſolued
<pb facs="tcp:15027:114"/>It is altogether manifeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is come to paſſe, and it nedeth no expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For is there any thing more diſparſed at this day, then the body of thys great Empyre. And although it be ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding becauſe that the ſole of the fote is of iron (as he ſayth) it ſhal remain always ſtable,<note place="margin">the romaine empyre ſhal endure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end.</note> &amp; it can not be altogether broken. But the remnant, the name and dignitie ſhall abide vntill ſuch time as Chriſt ſhall ende all humain thynges by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. We can in no wyſe doute, &amp; it is more cleare then the nooneday, that this Empyre is brought extremely thinne and lowe. That high tree is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len down, neuertheleſſe the roote doth yet abide and perſeuer: not with ſuch iuyce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it can ſpreade forth or encreaſe, but it is altogether drye. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there ſhalbe no humain power that can pluck vp thys roote or plant of the nature of iron: but it ſhal haue always roote in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth vntil ſuch time as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workmanſhip of this world be deſtroyd. We haue experience thereof. For diuerrs haue employ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed their powers to roote vp this litle &amp; ſtrayght poſſeſſion of the Empyre: amongeſt whome haue bene the popes &amp; the Turks. And albeit that thei haue done many enterpriſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; forcaſt to do more:<note place="margin">The pope &amp; the Turkes enemies of thempyre.</note> notwithſtanding they ſhal neuer come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point to compare or make their power equall (let them do what they wyll) with the greatnes of that of the Romains: neither ſhal they ouerthrow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> litle remna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empyre, although it be dry &amp; without iuyce.<note place="margin">There ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be no fifte monarchie.</note> For it is not poſſible to eſtabliſhe a fifte mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Trewe it is that Germany only hath the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15027:114"/>title and poſſeſſion of thempyre: but if ſhe knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether her powers &amp; courages, it ſhalbe eaſie for her to repreſſe al outward violence: a thing proue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by diuers examples. A few yeres paſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes paſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtraight of Thracia, and proyed and ſpoyed all ouer Europa: and at this preſent haue ſo enlarged them ſelues that theyr dominion bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth vpon Germanye. Wherethrough ſhe is in great daunger aſwell as Italy, for the nearenes. Howbeit if we marke Daniel more narowly, it is to be hoped that their ſtrength &amp; power is come euen to the vppermoſt ſteppe. For Daniel attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto them but only thre hornes (as we haue ſayd) the which they now obtain,<note place="margin">The three hornes of the Turkes</note> firſt of al in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the dominion of Aſia, afterwards of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia &amp; of Egipt. The whole countrey of that regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be comprehended vnder the name of Grecia, euen almoſte vnto Sclauonia. And albeit that in our tyme they occupie a great part of Hungary: &amp; that they poſſiblie, may vexe and trouble Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys thereabout: not withſtanding becauſe their dominion is to be encloſed within certaine limittes, &amp; maye not be comparable with the romaine power (as we haue already ſhewed) it is very lykely that theſe Prouinces ſhall not be aſſubiected vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as are thother three, Grecia, Egipt and Aſia. They ſhall make warre againſt the ſaincts, &amp; exerciſe all maner of crueltie againſt the chriſtians: and their fury ſhal endure euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world as Daniel plainly witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. This is the principall cauſe of his propheſie:
<pb facs="tcp:15027:115"/>to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beyng aduertiſed and certified of the calamities &amp; miſeries of the laſt time we ſhuld not be diſcouraged, but ſhuld waite for deliuerance by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt, who will come ſhortly after theſe afflictions, as he ſaith, &amp; will carie his into a ſure &amp; peaſible place, wyping al teares from their eies. Certain places of Daniell do properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the Iewes, vnto whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the captiuitie is promiſed, &amp; the time that the Meſſias promiſed vnto the fathers ſhuld come, is noted &amp; ſignified. The other prophecies touching the laſt age of the world &amp; them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall liue at ſuch time as the litle Horne,<note place="margin">Reuelation of antichriſt</note> which is the poſteritie of Mahomet, ſhal make war vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaincts, &amp; that that wicked &amp; abominable man of ſinne, who ſyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the temple of god, ſhewing himſelf as if he were god, ſhalbe reueled &amp; opened. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Daniel hath forſhewed his tirannie, as Paull expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth in his epiſtles.<note place="margin">The fury of Sathan at the ende.</note> Sathan, whom Chriſt himſelf calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince of this world, ſhal alwaies rage, but chiefly in the laſt age of the world, &amp; ſhal ſlacke &amp; louſe all bridles of fury, ſtirring vp aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries vnto Chriſt, who ſhall not only be tiranous and cruel by power of armes, but alſo by falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſhal draw men into deceipt and error; in ſuch ſort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very elect ſhall hardly eſcape their ſnares. This truly is the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daniel ſignifieth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xii. Chap. which ſhould be ſo miſerable &amp; deſolate, as neuer hath ben y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like, nor ſhalbe. For he promiſeth vs not any thing pleaſant: but horrible perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when he ſaith that the calamities whereof he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15027:115"/>ſpeaketh, ſhal endure vntil the diſperſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand or aſſembly of holy people be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed. The peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of God then ſhalbe vexed through the whole earth. And the godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe afflicted in diuers places, as long as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſhall endure. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch teſtimony of the prophet, or rather of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angell, doth cut of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs all hope of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction &amp; reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he alwaies ſpeaketh of diſperſion &amp; diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion: &amp; putteth the end when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcords ſhalbe rai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed for cauſe of the religion, at whych tyme Chriſt ſhal appeare. But for to comfort lyft vp &amp; ſuſtayne them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall then liue, he incontinently after theſe miſeries addeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead. And we ought earneſtly to pray vnto god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may proue and fele it ioyfull &amp; comfortable. The meane while Chriſt himſelf autoriſeth daniel:<note place="margin">Daniell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Chriſt.
